# AI Summer School Study Materials

The summer school at FIT CTU - With Artificial Intelligence in the Online Space is designed for high school students who are interested in modern technologies and want to learn more and effectively use artificial intelligence tools.


This repository contains code examples and guides for students, so they have some technical foundations to build their own applications using AI.

## 1. Data poisoning example

[data_poisoning.ipynb](data_poisoning.ipynb)

The main purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate AI vulnerability, where two models are trained - feed-forward neural network and logistic regression, on which data poisoning attack is applied.

## 2. Example of web chat bot using OpenAI

[example-chat-app](example-chat-app)

This is an example of simple web applications with server-side rendering and client-side interactivity. 

Used technologies:
- Python
- OpenAI
- FastAPI
- HTML, CSS and Javascript

## 3. Example of using OpenAI API

[openai_intro.ipynb](openai_intro.ipynb)

This notebook contains examples of how to use OpenAI API, so students can start using LLM in their applications to solve tasks.
